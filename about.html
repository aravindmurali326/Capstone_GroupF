<h1 style="text-align:center;">About Paaj Fitness</h1>
<pre style="text-align:center;">
Proudly Canadian? So are we! Paaj Fitness opened its first location in Mississauga on a bright and sunny Friday
in April 2011 with the goal of assisting Canadians in getting fit at a low cost.
Since that wonderful day, we've continued to grow rapidly, opening more than 100 locations across Canada. 
We have a gym close to you whether you're exploring Peggy and her cove in Nova Scotia or skiing the majestic mountains in British Columbia.

We want you to feel at ease in our welcoming, no-judgment gyms. Paaj Fitness has something for everyone, whether you want to get in shape,
make new friends, or simply unwind. We may lack the glitz and glam of a boutique gym, but your wallet will thank you!

Not sure where to begin? Request that one of our wonderful hosts show you around and acquainting you with the gym and
all of the great benefits Fit4Less has to offer. We will make you feel right at home, from our quick and easy 30-Minute Express CircuitÂ 
to our wide variety of machine and weight options.
